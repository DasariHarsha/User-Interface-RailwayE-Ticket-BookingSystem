                    This is one of the most popular and most beautiful roads in India. An easy weekend getaway from Pune or Mumbai is a road trip to famous tourist places in Maharashtra such as Lonavala, Khandala and Mahabaleshwar. Venture out on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway on an outstation cab and you will find much sought break from the noise, crowd and pollution of the mega cities. While many government and private buses ply on this route, but nothing can beat the viewing pleasures offered by a cab! While this is a perfect road trip to partake all through the year, but the beauty of this road is amplified when the monsoons arrive at the Western Ghats.                  </details>

So go to ‘My Profile’ on the IRCTC website and make a Master List with all passenger details.Too many people make this basic blunder. Before entering into an IRCTC Tatkal booking session you should not only have an idea about your source and destination stations but also have their station codes copied and pasted on a Notepad file. Searching for station codes after the screen appears, will minimize your chances of booking the ticket.</details>

                    Decoding Lower Berth quota for Senior Citizens
				</p></b>
				<p style="color: #000000; font-size: 20px; text-align:left ; margin: 10px 25px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
					Many a times while trying to book tickets in lower berth quota for senior citizens, you are met with utter despair. It makes you question the point of having a special seat arrangement under Indian railway senior citizen quota.<details style="color: #000000; font-size: 20px; text-align:left ; margin: 10px 25px; margin-bottom: 30px;"><summary>Read more</summary> But what if we tell you, there are many unstated rules that keep you away from booking lower berths for senior citizens. So, let us tell you about these unknown rules.Everyone knows that there is a special lower berth quota for senior citizens. But this is only half of the rule and no one mentions the limitations of this quota.

                        Lower berth quota for senior citizens’ rule: “There are six lower berths reserved in each Sleeper coach and three lower berths per coach in 3 AC and 2 AC for senior citizens.”
                        
                        Let us explain the seat divisions (keeping Sleeper coaches as our reference, for the ease of your understanding):
                        
                        Total Number of Sleeper Coaches: On a general level any express train has 12 Sleeper coaches.
                        Total Number of Seats: There are 72 seats in each of the 12 Sleeper coaches, making the total number of available seats 864 (72X12)
                        Number of Lower Berths in a Coach: Each row in a compartment has 3 lower berths which makes the total lower berths in a coach number 24 (72 ÷3).
                        Total Lower Berth Seats in Sleeper Class: As there are 12 sleeper coaches and in each of them there are 24 lower berths, so the total lower berth coaches in sleeper class are 288 (24X12).
                        Lower Berth Seats available for Senior Citizens: As per the quota regulation, each of the coaches has six seats for senior citizens which makes the total available lower berths at 72 (6X12).</details>

                    Facts about Chain Pulling in train you never knew before!

				</p></b>
				<p style="color: #000000; font-size: 20px; text-align:left ; margin: 10px 25px;">
                    Emergencies may arise anytime during a train journey. And at such times you would dearly want to stop the train or draw attention towards the crisis. The code of practice for train travel emergencies is: to stop the train,  it is improbable for the passengers to rush to those rooms seeking help during their emergencies.<details style="color: #000000; font-size: 20px; text-align:left ; margin: 10px 25px;"><summary>Read more</summary>The alarm chains are connected to the main brake pipe of a train. This brake pipe maintains a constant air pressure, helping the train move smoothly. When the emergency chain is pulled, the air stored in the brake pipe escapes, through a small vent. The drop in air pressure leads to the slowing down of the train. The loco pilot quickly notices this drop in the air pressure and starts maneuvering the train. As the train runs on narrow rails, so it cannot be brought to a sudden standstill, as that could lead to imbalance causing derailment.In the past, there used to be chains or either side of the coach walls (for ready use by the passengers). But, Indian railways has cut down on their numbers in the recent times (due to their misuse). Today, there is a single chain, mostly situated in the middle portion of every coach.</details>
